Microgreen Data Service is a cloud-based data logging solution for the EnergyPak lithium battery. It is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that is used by the customer to connect to the hardware module and send the data to the cloud. The backend is a cloud-based service that receives the data from the hardware module and stores it in a database. The hardware module is an ESP32 microcontroller that is connected to the EnergyPak via a RS485/232 communication cable.

## Inspiration
Currently, when a customer reports an issue with their EnergyPak lithium battery, our technical support team does not have any method to gather data from the battery to aid in our diagnosis. A recently developed app, [EPDataLog](https://github.com/MicrogreenSolarCorp/EPDataLog), can aid with this issue, but the user must have a computer physically connected to the EnergyPak, ensure that the computer doesn't go to sleep, and then must forward that data via email to Microgreen's technical support team.

This project aims to solve those shortcomings with a cloud-based solution. We would send the customer a hardware module that the user would then connect to their EnergyPak. The module will log data from the EnergyPak and send it to a cloud where the technical support team would be able to see it from an internal frontend dashboard.

## Components
There are frontend, backend, and hardware components to this project. The frontend is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that is used by the customer to connect to the hardware module and send the data to the cloud. The backend is a cloud-based service that receives the data from the hardware module and stores it in a database. The back-end also provides an internal dashboard for the technical support team to view the data. The hardware module is an ESP32 microcontroller that is connected to the EnergyPak via a RS485/232 depending on the BMS version.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a bluetooth method of data communication (useful if user doesn't have a Wifi connection)
- Expand the project to support other Microgreen products like the PowerPak
- Add the ability to write BMS parameters to the EnergyPak
