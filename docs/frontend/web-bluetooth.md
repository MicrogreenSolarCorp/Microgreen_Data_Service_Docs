# Web Bluetooth

## Why Web Bluetooth?
Since we are using a PWA, we do not have access to the device's native bluetooth API. This means that we have to use the Web Bluetooth API. The Web Bluetooth API is a browser API that allows websites to communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

## Limitations
- Only works on Chrome and Edge
    - Users must download the PWA from a Chrome or Edge browser
